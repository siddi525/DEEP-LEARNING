 Digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Network
The MNIST dataset, officially known as "The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits," is a famous dataset used to train machine-learning models (and neural networks) to recognize handwritten digits. Each digit in the dataset consists of a 28x28 array of numbers representing pixel values from 0 to 255. In this example, we will use Keras to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset. The dataset is included in Keras as a sample dataset, so we'll begin by loading it and examining its content and structure.
